  fullDescription: `This project adds its own custom system to Unturned in order to decay buildables from the game in 
    any way the final user desires. That could be that the buildable instantly gets destroyed if the user hasn't been 
    online long enough, or that they receive damage over time, or maybe they want to do it to a whole base with 
    protection.`
