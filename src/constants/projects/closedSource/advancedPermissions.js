  shortDescription: 'A full fledged permission system in .NET.',
  fullDescription: `Advanced Permissions originally started as an improvement to the RocketMod framework's permission 
    system for unturned so that a more user friendly, robust and expandable system was available. It has been evolving 
    into its own fully standalone permission system, with roles, users, permissions for both, temporary role 
    memberships, and more. Currently this evolution is still a WIP, but it is currently running the basic permission 
    features.`
