  shortDescription:
    'An Unturned Plugin that groups up barricades & structures around the map to define a player built base.',
  fullDescription: `This project was meant to provide the ability to define, use, interact, and modify as one wants 
    a player built base within the game 'Unturned'. It uses primitive clustering methods, as none of the objects are 
    linked or related, so all of them have to be investigated.`
